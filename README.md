War Card Game
A card game developed in C, that allows 2-10 players to go to War!

Each player is randomly given a set of cards which are determined by suit and they have to select the highest unique card in that particular round to win. 
However if it's a tie then the points are carried to the next round making it a very important round.

After each round the player has the opportunity to save the game or start a new game, along with viewing the status of the game or exit without saving. The user can then load these saved games at any time.
